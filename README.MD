# Project Structure

## Tech Stack

- React + Tailwind – Ideal for quick UI development with great flexibility. 
- Express + JWT – Lightweight and secure way to handle API requests and user sessions. 
- Database Choice: PostgreSQL vs MongoDB

  For this app: PostgreSQL is the better choice due to clear entities (users, courses) and potential relationships (e.g. user-course enrollments in the future).
